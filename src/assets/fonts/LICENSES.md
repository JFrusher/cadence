# Bundled font licences

Every face bundled with Cadence is under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, which
permits redistribution and embedding in documents. The full licence text for

Fonts a user uploads are never redistributed — they stay in that user's browser,
in IndexedDB, and are embedded only into PDFs that user generates on their own
machine.

Only one weight per family is bundled. Extra weights are a matter of dropping
more files here and adding rows to `index.ts`; nothing else in the app needs to
change.
